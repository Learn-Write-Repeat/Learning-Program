# Problem Statement
A company wants to automate the loan qualifying process (in real time) based on information provided by customers while filling out an online application form. Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and other facts are included.
To automate this procedure, they created a problem to identify the client segments that are qualified for a loan amount, allowing them to target these consumers individually. They have provided a limited data set in this case.
