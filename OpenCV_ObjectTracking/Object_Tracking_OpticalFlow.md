Optical Flow
*********************************************

Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movemement of object or camera. It is 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from first frame to second. The image below shows a ball moving in 5 consecutive frames and the arrow shows its displacement vector.

 Optical flow has many applications in areas like :

    * Structure from Motion
    * Video Compression
    * Video Stabilization and many other.
    
The illustration of Object Tracking using Optical flow has been done in this respective project.
